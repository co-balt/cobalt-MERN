### Co-Balt: real software development and tech training from novice to expert

### MERN?
<b> What is the MERN stack?</b>
<p> MERN stands for M(ongo), E(xpress), R(eact), N(ode)</p>
<p> It's a javascript-only web development stack. Mongo provides the database. Node is a server which runs an Express-based API. The client-side web framework is React.</p>
<p> If you are unfamiliar with the concepts of #database, #api, #server, and #client, you might want to ask a cobalter before proceeding.</p>
