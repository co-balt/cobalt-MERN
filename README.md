### MEVN?
<b> What is the MEVN stack?</b>
<p> MEVN stands for M(ongo), E(xpress), V(ue), N(ode)</p>
<p> It's a javascript-only web development stack. Mongo provides the database. Node is a server which runs an Express-based API. The client-side web framework is Vue.</p>
<p> If you are unfamiliar with the concepts of #database, #api, #server, and #client, you might want to ask a cobalter before proceeding.</p>
